# Download information from all blocks and transactions

In the following, the `--continue` flag will keep the program running when the current tip of the chain is reached. Otherwise the program will terminate when it reaches the tip.

If the `--restart` flag, followed by a filename, is used, then the program will attempt to start watching the chain at the point specified in the file. (Because of the possibility of a fork, this is not guaranteed to be possible.) If the file does not exist or is unreadable, then the program will start watching at the very start of the chain. In any case, the program will record in this file the latest point reached. This file can be manually edited to specify the slot number and block header's hash, for instance from the [Cardano Explorer](https://explorer.cardano.org/).
